**Project Summary**

This website is one of the five final/community projects given to students of RED Academy's Web Development Professional Program. The project gave us, as students, a look at how a real world project from a real world client gets built from the ground up.

The project offered up many different challenges regarding the development environment, UX designer to Web developer communication, and the short two and a half week deadline, just to list a few.

As a group, we are extremely proud of what we accomplished in the past two and a half weeks. We originally scoped the completion of perhaps half of the site but we came together as a group and are looking to complete the entire site.
